# LMM_OC_sand_clay
This repo contains the R-project and associated files to remodel sand, clay and OC from 0-30cm. 
These will all be modelled with freely available data and EM along with measurements of sand, clay and OC  to obtain predictions of these attributes (respectively) accross the farm.

OC will also be modelled without EM (only freely available data) and measurements of OC, to use as the OC map for scenarios that don't have on farm data.
